# blender-ue4-tools
This Blender addon improves workflow between Unreal Engine 4 and Blender.

## Compatibility
This addon is compatible with Blender 2.80.0.

## Original UE4 Tools by Lluis Garcia
This addon is inspired by and is a rework of popular UE4 Tools plugin by Lluis Garcia:
https://github.com/lluisgarcia/UE4-Tools

Though the original plugin was quite good, it was using old / obsole API, which made it very difficult
to upgrade it's code to 2.80.0. Furthermore, at the time of writing, the original addon was left untouched for 3 years.

That's why I made a decision to re-implement the plugin from scratch.
